# Intelligent Crop Recommendation and Farm Management System
## *Using Machine Learning*

## 📖 Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Machine Learning-based web application** designed to help farmers make data-driven decisions about crop selection, fertilizer application, and irrigation management. 

The system analyzes:
- Soil nutrients (**NPK** - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
- Soil pH levels
- Real-time weather conditions

...to provide personalized agricultural recommendations.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### 🌱 Crop Recommendation
- Predict the most suitable crop based on soil and weather conditions.
- Suggest alternative crops for diversification.

### 🧪 Fertilizer Optimization
- Calculate exact fertilizer requirements (**Urea, DAP, MOP**).
- Reduce over-fertilization and cost.
- Prevent soil degradation.

### 💧 Water Management
- Calculate daily water needs per hectare.
- Consider seasonal rainfall patterns.

### 🌦️ Real-time Weather Integration
- Fetch live temperature, humidity, and rainfall data.
- Provide location-based weather recommendations.

### 🌍 Soil Health Monitoring
- Analyze **NPK levels** and **pH balance**.
- Provide soil amendment suggestions.
- Maintain long-term soil fertility.
